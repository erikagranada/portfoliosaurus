I am currently a Senior Technical Writer in the Connections and Domino teams at HCL Software, handling former IBM products.

Over the last few years, I have worked with software development teams, creating technical specifications and content for developer portals. I’m interested in creating product or service experiences with development/design companies that value inclusivity, diversity, and learning.
